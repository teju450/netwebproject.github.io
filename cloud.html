<p>  The need for high performance compute re-sources especially in India is set to continue to grow. Companies / Organizations that rely on HPC technology continue to seek access to these resources to keep up with computational demands from the engineers and researchers. Meeting these demands and keeping pace with the latest technology allows organizations to grow and maintain a competitive advantage. Capital spending restrictions, lack of knowledge, resources & infrastructure in place at many organizations coupled with the growth for the need of these re-sources is creating a gap that needs to be filled.
 	
32 Node HPC Cluster with 64 x E5-2697v2 Processors. (768 Cores)
Out of the above, 4 nodes have 1x Intel Xeon Phi installed.
Memory 2048 GB ( 2.6 GB/Per Core)
HDD- SATA 1000 GB / Per Node
InfiniBand Interconnect
Dedicated Redundant Lease Lines.
Efficient Rack, Power & Cooling
And a promising solution to fill this gap is strongly expected to be “HPC as a Service” i.e “Pay-as-you-use model”.

Netweb Technologies being one of the prominent future forward solution providers in the HPC space in India in 
collaboration with Intel® has come up with “HPC as a Service” model with various services options.</p>
