<p>Netweb's HPCC solutions are built using leading industry-standard building blocks and best-in-class partner products.
 The result is a highly scalable HPCC solution that can deliver exceptional performance and manageability at a fraction of the cost of competing solutions. We offer a wide choice of systems
 and interconnects allowing you to choose the best solution for your requirements. Our systems range from single socket to quad-socket and in various form-factors including the revolutionary Twin1U which packs two servers inside a single 1U chassis to deliver unparalleled density. This 0.5U density (84 server nodes in a standard 42U rack) combined with optional onboard InfiniBand or 10GbE makes these platforms an excellent choice for high-performance computing (HPC) clusters where space, cost, energy-efficiency and density are high priorities.
Our 10-blade server system based on the SBI-7125C-T3 blade is an extremely cost-effective supercomputer.
 This solution now provides the scientific community the opportunity to enable a personal supercomputer next to their desks with the same computing power previously only available via large server installations in a dedicated IT room. This optimized blade solution features 93% power supply efficiency, innovative and highly efficient thermal and cooling system designs, and industry-leading system performance-per-watt (300+ GFLOPS/kW), making it the greenest, most power-saving blade solution.
